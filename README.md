# Recursion-Program-X-to-the-power-of-X
This Java program was created as part of my Discrete Structures class to demonstrate the concept of recursion. The program asks the user for an integer input and calculates that number raised to the power of itself (e.g., input 5 â†’ calculates 5^5 = 3125) using a recursive method.

The recursive method, recursion(int base, int exponent), illustrates how a problem can be solved by repeatedly breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem: a fundamental concept in both recursion and discrete mathematics. The base case checks if the exponent is zero and returns 1 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1). Otherwise, it continues multiplying the base until the exponent is reduced to 0.

This project highlights the practical application of recursion in problem-solving, specifically in computing powers: a topic closely tied to mathematical induction, recurrence relations, and algorithmic thinking, all of which are core ideas in discrete structures.
